# CountDown
A simple countdown to Happy New Year

I spent 40 mins on this exercise. For a simple count down function, I just use JavaScript to build this count down clock.

Using JavaScript is very simple and lightweight, it has no dependencies. The website will also perform in a better way because there is no any other plugins. It also will be more easy to control because this clock will behave exactly the way I want.

There are also some improvements in the next step:
I added updateClock() to adjust initial time delay caused by setInterval() at the beginning. 
I may add a set timmer to set the begin time to count down. Like schedule the count down clock on specific date.
It can also still keep counting down when user across the page.
